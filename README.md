#  Black-Out

> *"Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes... chaos."* – The Joker

**Black-Out** is a multithreaded HTTP stress-testing tool forged in madness. Designed to mimic various denial-of-service scenarios, this agent of chaos was built by **J0K3R** to measure the limits of your server's sanity.

It's not just a tool.  
It's a *statement*.
